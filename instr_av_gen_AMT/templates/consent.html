                    <p>You have been invited to take part in a research study to learn more about human emotion and cognition.  This study is being conducted by Dr Agnes Norbury, Research Associate at the Computational and Biological Learning Laboratory, University of Cambridge.</p>

                    <p>If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete the following tasks: </p>
                    <p>1)  View and respond to simple visual stimuli (coloured shapes) on your computer screen</p>
                    <p>2)  Complete some questionnaires related to sensitive topics, including mental health</p>
                    <p>3)  Provide some general information about yourself: specifically your age and gender identity.</p>

                    <p>There are no known risks associated with your participation in this research. If you become upset 
                    while completing the questionnaires, which cover some sensitive topics, you should take one of the
                    following actions: (1) arrange a timely appointment with your physician, clinical psychologist or
                    psychiatrist, or if you are having suicidal thoughts (2) visit a hospital emergency room or urgent care
                    center or (3) please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1800-273-8255). Further 
                    information and links to mental health resources outside of the US can be found 
                    at centreforglobalmentalhealth.org/global-mental-health-websites.</p>

                    <p>You will receive a $2.50 flat fee for participating, plus you will receive additional compensation 
                    depending on the responses you make during the first section of the study  - up to around $2.50 extra, depending on how well you do. Participation in this study is voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw at any time without penalty.</p> 

                    <p>If there is anything about the study or your participation that is unclear or that you do not
                    understand, if you have questions, or wish to report a research-related problem, you may contact Dr
                    Agnes Norbury, aen31@cam.ac.uk, Computational and Biological Learning Laboratory, University of
                    Cambridge Dept of Engineering, Trumpington Street, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, UK.</p>

                    <p>Any specific information gathered in the study will be disclosed only to the investigator or
                    collaborators.  If the results are published, the information remains anonymous and disguised so
                    that no personal identification can be made.</p>
